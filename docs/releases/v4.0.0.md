## Breaking changes 💔

## Ingress NGINX Controller

Upstream Ingress NGINX Controller has introduced some breaking changes in version 1.12.0 included in this version of the ingress module. We recommend reading [upstream's changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/changelog/controller-1.12.0.md). Here's a list of changes that could possibly impact you as a user of the module:

- Remove `global-rate-limit` feature. This removes the following configuration options:

  - `global-rate-limit-memcached-host`
  - `global-rate-limit-memcached-port`
  - `global-rate-limit-memcached-connect-timeout`
  - `global-rate-limit-memcached-max-idle-timeout`
  - `global-rate-limit-memcached-pool-size`
  - `global-rate-limit-status-code`

  It also removes the following annotations:

  - `global-rate-limit`
  - `global-rate-limit-window`
  - `global-rate-limit-key`
  - `global-rate-limit-ignored-cidrs`

- Remove 3rd party lua plugin support. This removes the following configuration options:

  - `plugins`

  It also removes support for user provided Lua plugins in the `/etc/nginx/lua/plugins` directory.

- Enable security features by default ([#11819](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/pull/11819)).

  - `--enable-annotation-validation` flag gets enabled by default.
  - `allow-cross-namespace-resources` option gets disabled by default.
  - `annotations-risk-level` option gets lowered to "High" by default.
  - `strict-validate-path-type` option gets enabled by default.

Upstream Ingress NGINX Controller has also corrected a few critical CVEs in version 1.12.1, included in this version of the ingress module. We recommend reading [upstream's changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/changelog/controller-1.12.1.md) to check if you have been impacted.

## external-dns

- **Cloudflare provider**: a breaking change has been introduced in v0.16.0, please see [this issue](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/issues/5166) for more details.

- **AWS Route 53 provider**: starting from v0.16.0, external-dns will create `AAAA` Alias records by default (see PR [#5111](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/pull/5111)). This behavior can be disabled with the following command line parameter: `--exclude-record-types=AAAA`, for example when using IPv4-only load balancers.
