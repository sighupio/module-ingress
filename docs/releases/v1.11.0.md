# Ingress Module version 1.11.0

Ingress Module is part of the SIGHUP maintained [SIGHUP Distribution](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution). The
module ships Ingress Controller and TLS certificate management
components you need to manage external access to your services in your
cluster. Team SIGHUP makes it a priority to maintain these modules in
compliance with CNCF and with all the latest features from upstream.

This release introduces the support for Kubernetes runtime `1.22` and drops support for `1.18`. Refer the Compatibility Matrix for more. Refer the [Compatibility Matrix](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-ingress#compatibility) for more.

## Upgrade Guide

### Warnings

* Note that, from the release `1.22` on, Kubernetes drops `Ingress` support in `extensions/v1beta1` and `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1`. Any resources using this versions will have to be re-written.
* The changes to [`spec.backend`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#ingress-v122) is also to be referred.
* Upgrade process for Cert-manager and ingress as far as this module is concerned should be smooth.
