# Ingress Module version 1.8.1

The previous 1.8.0 release includes a couple of issues in the Fury ingress stack.
This release solves these problems to provide a smooth experience.

## Changelog

- `nginx-gke` was not rendering *(`kustomize`)* because of an incorrect bases path. **Solved**
- Add missing `nginx-ovh`.

## Upgrade path

To upgrade this core module from `v1.8.0` to `v1.8.1`, you need to download this new version, then apply the
`kustomize` projects. No further action is required.

```bash
kustomize build katalog/nginx-gke | kubectl apply -f -
kustomize build katalog/nginx-ovh | kubectl apply -f -
```
