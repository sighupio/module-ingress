# Ingress Module Release v4.1.1


Welcome to the latest release of `Ingress` module of [`SIGHUP Distribution`](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution) maintained by team SIGHUP.

This release updates the NGINX Ingress Controller to version 1.13.3, fixing pod startup failures caused by a hard-coded `proxy_busy_buffers_size` default that conflicted with NGINX's validation when custom proxy buffer configurations were used.
